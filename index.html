    <h3>Better an 'oups!' than a 'what if': Fern Kranoksuwankul</h3>
    <p>
         &emsp; Hi! I’m fern. I’m originally from Thailand and I graduated with a business management degree. Art and design has always been my passion but I never take it seriously until after a year of working in management field. I actually found myself so lively and so inspired in creative environment, so I came to this realization that maybe a creative industry would suit me more than my current career path.

         &emsp; Then I decided to search on what would serve both of my practical sense and my creative side, also is it going to be something that I can keep up with in the near future? After I found out about UX/UI design, I thought that this might be the answer to it all! And since it is related to IOT, this is the main reasons why I choose web coding as my elective. I know that this skill will be beneficial in so many ways.

         &emsp; Currently, I’m using 15inch MacBook Pro, Intel core i7 along with 13inch iPad Pro. I use my iPad more than I expected but now I’m glad that I’m using my MacBook more for coding. I also looking forward for more to create a decent website and anything related.

         &emsp; To start and get my environment up and running for this class was a little challenging. I spend a good hour to fix ‘operation not permitted’ on git operation error. The issue wasn’t resolved according to the ‘README’ suggestion. It actually fixed by adding <a link class="underline">export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"</a> to my bash profile. Click <a href="https://github.com/timcharper/git_osx_installer/issues/85"title="github" target="_blank">here</a> for more detail.
