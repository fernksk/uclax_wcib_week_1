    <h3>Welcome to my very first web page!</h3>

         &emsp; Hi! I’m Fern. I’m originally from Thailand. I graduated with a business management degree. Art and design has always been my passion but I never take it seriously until after a year of working in management field. I found myself more inspired in creative environment and as more as I create something art related, I came to this realization that maybe a creative industry would suit me better in a long run.

         &emsp; After I found out about UX/UI design, I thought that this might be the path that can serve both of my practical sense and my passion in creativity! And since it is related to IOT, this is the main reasons why I choose web coding as my elective. I know that this skill will be beneficial in so many ways.

         &emsp; Currently, I’m using 15inch MacBook Pro along with 13inch iPad Pro. I use my iPad more than I expected but now I’m glad that I’m taking this course, and finally be able to use my MacBook more efficiently.

         &emsp; To start and get my environment up and running with no experience in coding at all was a little challenging. I spend a good hour to fix ‘operation not permitted’ on git operation error. The issue wasn’t resolved according to the ‘README’ suggestion. It actually fixed by adding <a link class="underline">export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"</a> to my bash profile. Click <a href="https://github.com/timcharper/git_osx_installer/issues/85"title="github" target="_blank">here</a> for more detail.

       Other than that, these are some of my favorite websites, in terms of;

        <li><a href="https://masterclass.com" title="masterclass.com" target="_blank">Fun learning website</a></li>
    </ul>
